  description: "December 16, XXXX\nIt\u2019s extraordinarily cold today. I feel a
    storm coming\u2026all the weather stations have been saying that this is going
    to be one of the heaviest winters we\u2019ve had in decades. Lucy was panicking,
    calling me to make sure I would survive and everything\u2026I told her she was
    being dramatic, but maybe that was for my own sanity. I went and stocked up on
    things easy to eat\u2014the fridge hasn\u2019t been working, so I got simple
    vegetables and canned things. I figure it should be a week, max, and I can last
    that long. I\u2019d hate to be snowed in on the holidays, though\u2026I was finally
    going to get to visit my grandchildren\u2026\n\nDecember 17, XXXX\nThe storm\u2019s
    hitting harder than I thought. The snow on the roof is so heavy, I\u2019m worried
    it\u2019ll cave in. I tried to chop some wood to barricade it, but my hands are
    too weak now that I\u2019m older. I pushed my bed to the corner\u2014the corners
    are the sturdiest parts, so I feel safer there. The food\u2019s been fine, but
    since all the phone lines are down it\u2019s incredibly lonely. I\u2019m worried
    about my grandkids. They were at school today, because it didn\u2019t start snowing
    until this evening\u2026if they\u2019re not safe, I\u2019m not sure what I could
    do.\n\nDecember 18, XXXX\nI haven\u2019t heard anything from my family, and the
    snow\u2019s beginning to leak through the cracks in the wood. It smells like
    mold. My radio still works though, and it\u2019s been mostly static, but this
    morning I heard word of some refugee centers in town. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s
    where Lucy and the kids are, but it might be worth it. I don\u2019t know how
    much longer I\u2019ll make it here alone. I\u2019m leaving to go see what I can
    find\u2026it shouldn\u2019t be much longer\u2026"
